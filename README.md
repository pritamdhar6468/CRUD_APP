# CRUD Web Application
* This project is a simple Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB (a non-relational database). The application demonstrates essential backend development concepts, including routing, database integration, and server-side rendering using EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates).
# Technologies Used
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building fast and scalable server-side applications.
* Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and handling HTTP requests.
* MongoDB: A NoSQL, non-relational database that stores data in JSON-like documents, offering flexibility and scalability.
* EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates): A templating language that allows you to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript, helping you write less code and create reusable templates.
# Features
* Create: Add new items to the MongoDB database via a form.
* Read: View all items stored in the database in a list format.
* Update: Edit and update existing items in the database.
* Delete: Remove items from the database.
